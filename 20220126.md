#### Some helpful tidyverse resources

[Introduction to dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html)

[Learn to purrr](https://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-19_purrr/) - `purrr` is a useful package for iterating, compared to setting up complicated nested loops. It takes some practice but can result in very clean code once you get the hang of it - helpful if you have to read in data from many sources (e.g. multiple pages of a spreadsheet) or carry out a complicated simulation.

[Correcting a dataframe the tidyverse way](http://ritsokiguess.site/docs/2021/04/26/correcting-a-dataframe-the-tidyverse-way/) - If you have to make corrections to your original data and want to keep track of them, this suggests some useful functions that might simplify the process (hidden gems of tidyverse).
