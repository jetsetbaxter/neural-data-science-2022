[PDF of slides](./20220223_presentation_datavis.pdf) from in-class presentation.

[0220223_graphing.R](./20220223_graphing.R) - Demo code for plots shown in class.

[The Datasaurus Dozen](https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs)

["Reveal, don't conceal"](./Weissgerber2019.pdf) - Short paper about appropriateness of different data displays in research articles.

#### Some helpful resources

[ggplot2: Elegant graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org) - This is the full text of the book by Hadley Wickham, the developer of `ggplot2`, that lays out the theory behind the package and fully explicates its capabilities. Not an introduction.

[R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org) - Guide to making some of the most common kinds of plots.

[Making graphics with R](https://github.com/dhmontgomery/nicar20/tree/master/ggplot-graphics) - One of many online `ggplot2` tutorials that shows some useful tricks. Honestly, the best way to get good at using ggplot is to find examples online that you can adapt.

[Visualization in R: Mistakes, Fixes and Tools](http://nickstrayer.me/nashvilleBioStats//2016/05/visualization_in_r.html) - Very helpful website comparing different types of visualizations and different options for graphics within R. 

[Better data communication with `ggplot2`](https://github.com/gruggeri/ADSCV_media/blob/master/tidytuesday/cleaning_tate_artwork_bar.md) - An interesting use case with some fun tricks.

[Demystifying stat_layers in `ggplot2`](https://yjunechoe.github.io/posts/2020-09-26-demystifying-stat-layers-ggplot2/) - Using `stat_summary` in `ggplot2` can be a huge time-saver and give you nicer (and easier-to-maintain) code. 

[Summary statistics in `ggplot2`](https://ggplot2tutor.com/tutorials/summary_statistics) - another tutorial on adding summary statistics to ggplot graphs. Be a little careful with the `Hmisc` library, because it masks some of the tidyverse functions.

[Quick color reference](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour) - One of a number of websites that lists color names that `ggplot2` recognizes.

[Adding significance bars to ggplot grpahs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggsignif/vignettes/intro.html) - the `ggsignif` package!

[Creating corporate color palettes with `ggplot2`](https://drsimonj.svbtle.com/creating-corporate-colour-palettes-for-ggplot2) - How to make your own color palettes. For example, if there's an [album cover](https://github.com/asteves/tayloRswift) or [film](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) you'd like to reference! 

[Quickly assessing colour palettes](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2020/10/15/assess-colour/) - tips for using the `prismatic` package to check how color palettes behave for individuals with different kinds of color blindness.

[Export a high resolution graph for publication in R](https://rforbiochemists.blogspot.com/2015/05/export-high-resolution-graph-for.html) - quick tutorial about exporting an image to a graphics device.

[Graphics devices](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/graphics-devices.html) - Slightly more extensive treatment of options for using graphics devices to export plots.

[Taking control of plot scaling](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/08/taking-control-of-plot-scaling/) - More complex approach to making plots scaleable across different physical sizes (manuscript vs poster for example). 

[Terrifying graphs](https://twitter.com/biogeobiochem/status/1172547846479831040) - inspiration, perhaps?
