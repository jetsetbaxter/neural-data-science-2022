#### Some helpful (?) resources

[R Functions List](https://statisticsglobe.com/r-functions-list/) - Extensive list of many R functions, each linked to a short tutorial / example. A little variable in quality but might be a useful first stop or complement to the R help files.

[The R Inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf) - For programming aficionados, discusses inner workings of R and nuances of programming.

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) - Not exactly introductory but very comprehensive in terms of mechanics of using R to deal with data. Useful in combination with [STAT 545](https://stat545.com) materials. 

[Crash Course in R for Psychology Research](https://github.com/nmmichalak/novum_R_ganum/blob/master/learn_r_for_psychology_research_a_crash_course/learn_r_for_psychology_research_a_crash_course.md) - Helpful website designed to present R essentials to get you up to speed quickly with R and R Studio.

[R Studio Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) - These are incredibly useful to have to hand when you're getting used to doing things in R. Also the [syntax cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/syntax.pdf) is very instructive in terms of the many different ways to say things in R code.

[Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com) - Guide for using R Studio and GitHub together. There is an "R Project" workflow where you work within an R project in R Studio and can push this to GitHub so you can have easy-ish version control.
