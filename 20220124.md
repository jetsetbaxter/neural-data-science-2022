Answers to pre-assignment. 

#### Some helpful (?) resources

[The R Inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf) - For programming aficionados, discusses inner workings of R and nuances of programming.

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) - Not exactly introductory but very comprehensive in terms of mechanics of using R to deal with data. Useful in combination with [STAT 545](https://stat545.com) materials.
