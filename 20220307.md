[The origin of extracellular fields and currents â€” EEG, ECoG, LFP and spikes](./BuzsakiKoch2012.pdf) 

[Chronux](http://chronux.org) - A well-validated software package for various spectral analyses in Matlab

[Neural Signal Processing Tutorial](./Neural_Signal_Processing_Chronux.pdf) - This tutorial is based in Chronux, but includes useful information even if you don't use this platform

[Spectral Analysis in R](./Spectral.pdf)

[The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing](https://www.dspguide.com/pdfbook.htm) by Steven W. Smith. - This is an online text book for digital signal processing in engineering applications. If anyone wants more information on digital filters, like the bandpass filters we talk about in class, chapter 14 is excellent.
