[Linear Models with R](https://julianfaraway.github.io/faraway/LMR/) - This is my favorite linear models / regression text.

[Extending the Linear Model with R](https://julianfaraway.github.io/faraway/ELM/) - This is my favorite multilevel models text.

[Introducing linear mixed effects models](https://psyteachr.github.io/stat-models-v1/introducing-linear-mixed-effects-models.html) - Chapter from online textbook that introduces LMM approach through a slightly different motivation; may be useful complement to concepts discussed in class.

[Mixed Models with R: Getting started with random effects](https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/) - Tutorial/workshop materials that provides a great introduction to the topic.
