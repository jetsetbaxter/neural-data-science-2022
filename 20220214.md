[Getting started with `emmeans`](https://aosmith.rbind.io/2019/03/25/getting-started-with-emmeans/) - Introductory tutorial on using `emmeans` to calculate "post hoc" comparisons between group means within a factor in a linear model.

[Tests for Pairwise Mean Differences in R](https://timmastny.com/blog/tests-pairwise-categorical-mean-emmeans-contrast/) - The clearest explainer for the `emmeans` package to decompose complex effects.

[Basics of estimated marginal means](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/vignettes/basics.html) - Vignette for `emmeans` package that provides more comprehensive overview of its capabilities.

[Confidence intervals and tests in `emmeans`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/vignettes/confidence-intervals.html) - More technical vignette about using `emmeans` to generate confidence intervals and p-values.

[The `marginaleffects` package](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/) - An alternative to `emmeans` that may be more useful in some situations for examining, for example, interaction effects with continuous predictors.
