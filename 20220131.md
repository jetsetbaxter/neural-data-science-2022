## January 31, 2022: Power analysis

Code for examples shown in class:

[Example power analysis simulation](./20220131_power_analysis_sim_demo.R)

[March of the p-values](./20220131_march_of_the_p_values.R)

#### Some helpful resources

[Tidy simulation](http://ritsokiguess.site/blogg/posts/2021-11-14-tidy-simulation/) - This introduces the same concepts in using simulations to estimate statistical power, although with a slightly different coding framework. This might reinforce the ideas we talk about in class. It may be a little easier to think about doing this row-wise in a tibble than fooling around with purrr.
