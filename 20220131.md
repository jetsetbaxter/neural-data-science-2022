## January 31, 2022: Power analysis

Code for examples shown in class:

[20220131_power_analysis_sim_demo.R](./20220131_power_analysis_sim_demo.R) - Example power analysis simulation

[20220131_march_of_the_p_values.R](./20220131_march_of_the_p_values.R) - March of the p-values code

#### Some helpful resources

[Tidy simulation](http://ritsokiguess.site/blogg/posts/2021-11-14-tidy-simulation/) - This introduces the same concepts in using simulations to estimate statistical power, although with a slightly different coding framework. This might reinforce the ideas we talk about in class. It may be a little easier to think about doing this row-wise in a tibble than fooling around with purrr.

[Russ Lenth's power and sample size page](https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/index.html) - This has some helpful hints as well as a Java applet for power calculations (which I used for many years before I learned to code in R). Also the best resource to cite if anyone ever tells you to do a "post hoc power analysis".
