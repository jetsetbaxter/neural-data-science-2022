[Goodness of fit indices](http://www.davidakenny.net/cm/fit.htm) - Useful brief summary of different kinds of goodness of fit indices for SEM models.

[CenterStat Introduction to Structural Equation Modeling Workshop](https://centerstat.org/introduction-to-structural-equation-modeling/) - 3-day *free* seminar taught by professional quantitative methodologists. May 11-13 this year. Last year's seminar is still available. The instructors and materials for CenterStat workshops are absolutely outstanding. 

[Applications of covariance structure modeling in psychology: Cause for concern?](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steven-Breckler/publication/20834791_Applications_of_Covariance_Structure_Modeling_in_Psychology_Cause_for_Concern/links/5405d5920cf2c48563b1bc73/Applications-of-Covariance-Structure-Modeling-in-Psychology-Cause-for-Concern.pdf) - classic paper (1990) from the great Steve Breckler - who taught the first multivariate statistics course Baxter ever took. Outlines conceptual problems with using structural equation models, which are much more appreciated now but this is still a foundational article for people using these approaches.
