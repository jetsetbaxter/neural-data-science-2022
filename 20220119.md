## January 19, 2022: Introduction / refresher on probability and statistics

Please complete the [pre-assignment](./HW0.R) by today. We will discuss it on January 24. 

Hopefully you will already have R and R Studio installed on your computer, but if you don't, a guide is [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html). This document also has some helpful introductory exercises in R if you need a refresher.

The code to simulate a bimodal distribution of data, referenced in the presentation, is [here](./bimodal.R).

#### Some helpful resources

[Probability, Statistics, and Data: A fresh approach using R](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/probchapter.html) - Referenced in the presentation, this presents a framework for considering a variety of "named" statistical tests within a single framework of linear models. If you want to look "under the hood" and perhaps get a different perspective on material taught in introductory biostatistics, this might be interesting.

[Common statistical tests are linear models](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/) - `purrr` is a useful package for iterating, compared to setting up complicated netsted loops. It takes some practice but can result in very clean code once you get the hang of it - useful if you have to read in data from many sources (e.g. multiple pages of a spreadsheet).
